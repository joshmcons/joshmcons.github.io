# Objective
The legislative tracker was a semester long project requested by the Department of Education(DOE). The goal was to create a tracker that will help DOE employees keep track of numerous bills that they must work on everyday. The team consisted of 9 members. There were many key concepts that went into implementing a final product. Some concepts incorporated were: 
<ul>
  <li>Agile Project Management</li>
  <li>Design Patterns</li>
  <li>Functional Programming</li>
  <li>Coding Standards</li>
  <li>Deployment</li>
</ul>

The implementation was completely up to us to create while meeting the requests of our clients.

# Contributions
Our group managed our work using an issue-based project board consisting of six major milestones. Each member was in charge of either implementing something new to the application or improving its functionality. The areas that I focused on was the implentation of drafting testimonies where the user can upload their files as well as tracking those testimonies. Another area that I worked on was implenting the profile data of the user. The most challenging area for me were the Testimony pages since there was a lot to implement such as creating the page, implenting the collection, and keeping track of those testimonies in a list.

# Looking Back
When we were first put into our teams, the first thing that came to mind is that you never know who you would end up working with and what you would work on. Adaptability was the greatest thing we had to work on since there was always something new to consider or work on with our application. The project showed a small part of what it would be like in the real world and I was glad to experience it.
