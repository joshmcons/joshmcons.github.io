summary: Redesigning Moanalua High School's AFJROTC Website
---

In my Junior year of high school I held the position of Public Affairs Officer for Moanalua High School's AFJROTC. When I received the responsibility from my predecessor, there was a lot to be done. The website was completely outdated and disorganized and it looked like it wasn't touched in years. Since the management of the website fell under my jurisdiction, I wanted to revamp it. I proposed the idea to my instructor and he gave me free range in what to do for the website. 

The website was made through a company that allowed people to create their own free websites known as Weebly. At the time, I had no coding background nor did I know anything about maintaining a website. However, that allowed me to do research and help me learn how to manage a website. My favorite part about this project was clearing everything out and starting from scratch. I like doing things from scratch because it allows me to build everything the way I want it to be built. Though Weebly was very limited in resources, it allowed me to do what I needed to do for the website.

I divided the website to four main sections: Home, Cadet Guide, Calendar, and Events. This allowed users to easily access and go through whatever they want to see on the website. The Home page gave a basic summary of who the unit was as well as pictures. The Cadet Guide page consisted of facts and knowledge the cadets needed to know. The Calendar page consisted of a calendar that provides which events are coming for the year. Then the Events page was an archive of events that happened in the past.
