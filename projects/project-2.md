summary: Programming a drone using Arduino

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/ArduinoDrone.png">

During my Junior year of High School, my engineering class had an opportunity to build our own drones from a drone kit and program it using Arduino. This was one of my first experiences when it comes to coding and it was a lot of fun. Not only was it an experience with coding, but also with mechanical, software, and electrical components.

This project was also my first experience is running into multiple coding errors. My group and I would spend time outside of class to work on the code and I began to understood how much time and effort coding takes. It took roughly 2 weeks for my group to get the drone to work after multiple coding errors and finally getting our drone to fly was very satisfactory.
