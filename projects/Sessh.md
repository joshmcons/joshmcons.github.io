# Objective
Sessh was a project designed to show everything we learned from our software engineering course. I and a group of 4 other people were assigned the project idea of an app designed to find fellow musicians attending UH Manoa. The project incorporated many key concepts that we would implement so that we could deliever a final product. Some things that were incorporated were:
<ul>
  <li>Agile Project Management</li>
  <li>Design Patterns</li>
  <li>Functional Programming</li>
  <li>Coding Standards</li>
  <li>Deployment</li>
</ul>

We had full control on how the application would be designed and the deployment of the application was dependent on everyone completing their tasks on time.

# Contributions
We used an issue-based project board over three major milestones in order to keep track of what each member was doing and to even share the problems we have logged into our github repository. We found it easier to divide the work into smaller porblems and have everyone in charge of an area. In my case I was in charge of documentation, sign in and sign out pages, as well as the testcafe developments. The biggest challenge for me were implenting the testcafe development components, as I would have to go through multiple pages of code that work with one another and create a simulation to ensure that the pages were working properly. 

# Looking Back
Some things I learned during this project is how important deadlines are, and how deadlines help set the pace for creating the application. Everyone had their own work to do and there were times where some would fall behind or need help, and we did our best to ensure we worked together to meet our deadlines. It was stressful but also a fun project. It was rewarding and I have learned a lot from this project.
