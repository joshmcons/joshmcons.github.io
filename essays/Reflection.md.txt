# Reflection
Over the semester of taking ICS 314, I have learned a lot in regards to Software Engineering. We would learn something new every week and be tested on it the week after, then after learning the necessities, we would apply them all into a project with a team. The amount of things to learn every week could be quite challenging, but that's what it takes to learn something new. Software Engineering is qutie challenging but at the same time it was also fun to learn all these different things.

# Teamwork Can Go Both Ways
The biggest thing I learned growing up is how important teamwork is to create something successful. Working as a team could lead to something great whenever everyone works together, but it can also go downhill and be stressful when someone doesn't pull their own weight. When working as a team, you have to keep each other accountable to finish the tasks that need to be done. Each team member must make sure to complete their tasks on time and asking for help whenever they need it. Things can be rough at the start, especially if you have never worked with the people on your team before. However, once you get the ball rolling and know what to do, it makes things a lot easier. With everyone on the team working on an issue for the project, this led to constant progression of the project.

# Coding Can Get Messy
I've always liked to keep things simple and easy to look at, because the bigger a problem is the more disorganized and stressed you can get. That is why I prefer breaking things down into smaller problems and bringing all the solutions together. This isn't always the case as sometimes, your code would need to be quite messy in order for things to work. While working on the project, there were times that we would have to write lots of lines of code in order for things to work. While keeping things simple can make things easier, it won't always be the most effective way to do things.

# New Tools
I have experienced many different programming language and each time I use a new tool. During the course of the semester, I have learned to use many different tools at the same time. I feel that sometimes people want to use the tools that they have been using for a long time which isn't always a bad thing. However, software development continues to grow and more tools are being creted to make development easier. We are aware of different tools but we sometimes tend to use what we already know. This class introduced me to many different tools that I was not aware of and I'm glad that I have these tools to use in my career.
