Everyone has their own different way of writing their code and each code can be formatted in a different way. One example of this in real life is how each person has their own unique way of writing. Everyone writes their own way but it has to be readable to anyone that reads it. That is why coding standards help with the quality of code. Tools that help you with making your code cleaner make things a lot easier as they highlight parts of your code that could be made better. I've always had trouble with keeping my code clean and having a tool tell me what could be done to make it cleaner helps me out in the long run. This helps me learn as a programmer and gives me a better understanding of coding standards.

After a week of using IntelliJ and ESLint I can say that the formatting is a lot easier than what I've used in the past and marking my mistakes really help. I sometimes ignore the parts that I think work fine but for the most part it helps me see the things that I missed and I enjoy using them so far. It can be quite irritating sometimes seeing a lot of yellow and red marks on my code since I always want to try and make the code look as clean and perfect as possible but I understand that it's there to help me out. Overall coding standards has helped me push out better results and makes me more efficient with my work.
