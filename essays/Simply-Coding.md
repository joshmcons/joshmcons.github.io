Coding isn't always easy. When you first learn to code, it could be quite confusing. There are numerous things to remember and sometimes you don't know what the correct thing to use is. Like using a Double or an Integer, you have to decide on what to use in the beginning and if you change your mind as you code, then you'd have to change the initial variable again. With Javascript, it makes things a lot simpler. I've tried different programming languages before, but Javascript is not only easier but also more fun to use. With ES6, coding with Javascript is a lot easier and simpler. It eliminates the need to type as much code and makes the code easier to see. If I were a complete newbie, I believe I would have an easier time learning Javascript. It is also a good programming language from a software engineering perspective.

Athletic software engineering is not something that I would expect to hear. WODs are very useful because it challenges you in your skills and knowledge for Javascript and it is a great way to learn and polish your skills. It is quite enjoyable and when something is enjoyable, it makes someone want to do it over and over again. I like the challenge and I'm sure that others do as well, and it helps with retaining the knowledge you learned. Overall Javascript is fun and makes coding so much simpler, and it is definitely a good language skill to have in your pocket.
