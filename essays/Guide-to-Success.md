The future is always changing and you never know what lies ahead. Even having a whole plan laid out in front will not always mean it will go exactly as planned. Planning for the future and having a guideline is helpful however, and having as many options as possible allows you to adapt to the changes of the future. UH Manoa has been helpful for having RadGrad to help those studying Computer Science know what opportunities they have as well as see what options they can have. After my first interaction with RadGrad, I found it quite helpful to see what I can get into for the rest of my college career. I found a lot of classes and events that were of interest to me and I was surprised to see how many opportunities and classes I could take.

Some things that I found interesting going through RadGrad is the types of classes I could take. One of the classes that interested me was internet safety. One of the careers I had in mind for after college was to go into online security. I've always found people having trouble trusting what's on the internet and there are a lot of scammers or hackers on the internet. They are getting more creative and I want to be able to do something to prevent that. I also found the list of opportunities quite interesting. The different clubs and competitions that you could enter was mind-blowing and there was good amount that I took interest in.
