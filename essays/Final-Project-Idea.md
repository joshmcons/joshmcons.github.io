Overview
The problem: It is a common problem for students to lose track of the work the needs to be done for their classes. This leads to losing points that is needed to pass the class and can be stressful for your average student

The solution: UHssignments application allows students to login and create a list of tasks they need to do by organizing them for classes. Students can add and delete tasks throughout their student careers and even organize them by years.

Approach
UHssignments will allow students to login using their UH ID. Student can navigate the navigation bar by semesters and add their classes within those semester pages. They can then create a checklist of tasks they need to do and mark them by priority (low, medium, high). The tasks that are added can automatically be added into a calendar within the application so students can see what is coming up.

Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
Landing page
User home page
Calendar page
Semesters page
Classes page

Use case ideas
New users go to the landing page, log in, gets to the home page, then sets up their profile
Users will go to the semesters page, create a semester page, then add classes into the semester page where they add their tasks into the classes page

Beyond the basics
Set a reminder for each task and have it sent to their phones when the due date is approaching
Allow students to put their documents with the tasks for later use
