<h1>Overview</h1>
The problem: It is a common problem for students to lose track of the work the needs to be done for their classes. This leads to losing points that is needed to pass the class and can be stressful for your average student

The solution: UHssignments application allows students to login and create a list of tasks they need to do by organizing them for classes. Students can add and delete tasks throughout their student careers and even organize them by years.

<h1>Approach</h1>
UHssignments will allow students to login using their UH ID. Student can navigate the navigation bar by semesters and add their classes within those semester pages. They can then create a checklist of tasks they need to do and mark them by priority (low, medium, high). The tasks that are added can automatically be added into a calendar within the application so students can see what is coming up.

<h1>Mockup page ideas</h1>
Some possible mockup pages include:
<ul>
  <li>Landing page</li>
  <li>User home page</li>
  <li>Calendar page</li>
  <li>Semesters page</li>
  <li>Classes page</li>
</ul>

<h1>Use case ideas</h1>
<ul>
  <li>New users go to the landing page, log in, gets to the home page, then sets up their profile</li>
  <li>Users will go to the semesters page, create a semester page, then add classes into the semester page where they add their tasks into the classes page</li>
</ul>

<h1>Beyond the basics</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Set a reminder for each task and have it sent to their phones when the due date is approaching</li>
  <li>Allow students to put their documents with the tasks for later use</li>
</ul>
